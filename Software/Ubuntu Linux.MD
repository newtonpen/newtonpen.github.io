## Ubuntu Linux Transition: Daily Usage (Actively Learning)

-- PUT THE IMAGE HERE!!!! ---

I am currently in the process of transitioning to Ubuntu Linux for daily use, with the goal of fully replacing my Windows OS. This involves actively learning and adapting to the Linux environment for all my computing needs. This includes transitioning most my "Windows-Only" apps and make it compatiable with the Vavle "Proton" Compability layer to make it so it can run on linux. Composed Primary of Autodesk apps.

My learning and implementation efforts include:

* **Lighter Computer** Lighter operating system = More Performance. More Performance = Happier Times.
* **More Privacy** Open Source software doesn't take you data without you knowing.
* **Navigating the Ubuntu Desktop:** Becoming proficient with the user interface, file system, and command-line interface.
* **Software Management:** Learning to install, update, and manage applications using the Ubuntu Software Center and package managers (e.g., apt).
* **Customization and Configuration:** Exploring system settings and configurations to personalize the Ubuntu environment for optimal workflow.
* **Troubleshooting and Problem Solving:** Developing skills to diagnose and resolve common issues encountered during daily use.

This transition reflects a commitment to exploring open-source technologies and gaining a deeper understanding of operating systems.
