SDS2 is a leading Building Information Modeling (BIM) software solution tailored for steel detailing, fabrication, and construction. It offers powerful tools for creating intelligent 3D models for steel structures.

My experience with SDS2 includes:

* **Steel Detailing:** Utilizing SDS2 for the creation of accurate and constructible steel shop drawings.
* **Model-Based Fabrication:** Leveraging the 3D model for fabrication processes.
* **Construction Planning:** Understanding how SDS2 models can be used for erection planning and sequencing.
* **Importing into Revit** Export the SDS2 file as an IFC to put into a Revit Project.
