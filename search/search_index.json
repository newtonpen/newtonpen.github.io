I'm Newton! The phrase that could describe me the best is \"I love things that work together\". I started my engineering and photography career in 2021(when I was 15), along with my homelabbing journey. I earlier started my Golf jouney in 2016. I also take photographs and videos(mainly on Cars/Aircraft and Nature), with my following camera: iPhone 12 w/ND filter & Gimbal and I have been using these photos as a way to practice photo&video editing and expressing stories through articles of media. What I have Done and Contributed? I have experiences in using Architecture-Based CAD, Engineering CAD software, CFD software, APCSA-Level Java, Creating Servers and Virtual Containers for different use cases using ProxMox, knowing my way around Windows 11 and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Linux, and playing Golf for 7+ Years. In my ProxMox journey, I have spun up many different VM's and LXC Containers that host many different types of Services such as Home Assistant (Smart-Home Manager) Minecraft Server (for my friends&family) Wireguard (Easy outside connection to my home server) OpenMediaVault (Main File Storage Server) Paperless-NGX (File Organaizer using Local AI) Pi-Hole (Self-Hosted Network-Wide Ad&Tracker Blocker) NextCloud (Outbound File Sharing) PhotoPrism (Easy Photo Manager for my family) Homepage (Programmed my own startpage) Grafana (Server Uptime Dashboard) I use these VM's and LXC Containers to serve my family; including cousins in different counties, enjoy services without any techinical issues. I am about to graduate Santiago High School with Honors on June 4th, 2025 , earning an CTE certification, and obtaining my diploma.
