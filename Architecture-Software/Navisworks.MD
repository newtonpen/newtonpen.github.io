### What is Navisworks?

Navisworks is a leading 3D project review software by Autodesk, essential for coordinating design and construction data within the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry.

During the coursework, I gained practical experience in leveraging Navisworks for:

* **Clash Detection:** Utilizing Navisworks to identify and analyze interferences within integrated Revit models.
* **Model Integration:** Successfully importing Revit models into the Navisworks environment.
* **Clash Test Creation:** Developing and executing clash tests to ensure design coordination.
* **Results Reporting:** Generating comprehensive clash detection reports in both `.pdf` and `.html` formats for effective communication and issue tracking.
